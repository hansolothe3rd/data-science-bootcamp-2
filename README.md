# Data Science Bootcamp – Days 11–20

This repository contains the second stage of my **self-guided Data Science Bootcamp**, continuing from [Days 1–10](https://github.com/your-username/bootcamp-days-1-10).  
The focus here is building on the foundations with deeper dives into **data analysis, visualization, and real-world mini projects**.
