# Data Science Bootcamp – Days 11–20

This repository contains the second stage of my **self-guided Data Science Bootcamp**, continuing from [Days 1–10]((https://github.com/hansolothe3rd/Refresh.git)).  
The focus here is building on the foundations with deeper dives into **data analysis, visualization, and real-world mini projects**.
